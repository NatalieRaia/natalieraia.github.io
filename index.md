## Earth Science Cyberinfrastructure Research Principal

I am an earth science cyberinfrastructure researcher working at the intersection of geology, information science, and open data. With a decade of sample-based geochemistry research experience and training in metamorphic petrology and tectonics, I understand firsthand the challenges researchers face navigating the evolving landscape of data management, sample curation, and open science mandates.

My work focuses on increasing the discoverability, accessibility, and long-term preservation of scientific sample collections and data. I collaborate with library scientists, systems engineers, researchers, publishers, and academic societies to develop solutions that reduce friction in the open science ecosystem while meeting the practical needs of individual researchers.
