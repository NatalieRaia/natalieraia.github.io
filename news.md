## June 20, 2025 | New Publication: Sample Citation Infrastructure

A years-in-the-making paper is now out in *Nature Scientific Data*, led by Joan Damerow and Andrea Thomer with many co-authors. Leveraging key use cases and significant multi-year community engagement, we outline infrastructure gaps in the Earth Science sample data citation ecosystem, provide recommended best practices for sample citation, and identify key areas for future innovation.

## May 20, 2025 | Data Citation Study Published

New paper out in CODATA's *Data Science Journal*, co-authored with Kristina Vrouwenvelder (AGU) and Andrea Thomer (University of Arizona).
