## Research Focus

My research bridges earth science and information science, focusing on the sociotechnical aspects of scientific data infrastructure. Current projects include:

### Physical Sample Data Infrastructure

Investigating barriers to implementing persistent identifiers for physical samples and developing community-driven solutions for sample data citation and discovery. This work combines user experience research, stakeholder engagement, and systems analysis to improve the FAIR-ness (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) of sample-based research.

### Data Sharing Practices and Tools

Examining how researchers actually cite and manage datasets in their workflows, with a focus on identifying gaps in bibliographic management software and developing practical guidance for data citation best practices.

### Open Science Policy and Practice

Contributing to policy development and community standards around open data, sample curation, and scholarly communication in the earth sciences.

## Background: Metamorphic Petrology & Geochemistry

My doctoral research focused on high-pressure/low-temperature metamorphic rocks from New Caledonia, investigating serpentinite formation in subduction zones and the preservation of tectonic signals in exhumed terranes. This work combined field geology, petrographic analysis, and geochemical techniques to understand fluid-rock interactions and redox conditions in ancient subduction zones.

This hands-on research experience with samples, analytical instruments, and complex datasets informs my current work on data infrastructure—I understand the researcher's perspective because I've lived it.
